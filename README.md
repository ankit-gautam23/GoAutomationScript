Here's an example automation script in Go that can convert method signatures and return statements from C# to Go:

To use the script, you can save it to a file named convert.go and then run it from the command line with the path to a C# file as an argument, like this:
```
go run convert.go input.cs
```
The script will read the contents of the input file, convert the method signatures and return statements to Go syntax, and write the output to a file named output.go. You can then modify the output as necessary to complete the conversion process. Note that this script is a basic example and may not handle all edge cases or complex C# code.
